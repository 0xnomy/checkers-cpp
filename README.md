Title: Checkers Game in C++ Using Classes

Description:

This repository contains a checkers game implementation in C++, developed as an assignment for the CS112 course at GIKI. The game is played on an 8x8 board and features basic moves such as single diagonals, jumps, and kinging. The implementation uses object-oriented programming principles and class structures to represent the game state and game pieces.

The game is played in the terminal/console. Players can move their pieces by entering the starting and ending positions of the piece they want to move. The game provides basic validation for moves, such as checking if a move is legal, whether a player has won, and if a piece can be kinged.

The code is well-structured and easily understandable. The game also includes features such as error handling and input validation to ensure the game runs smoothly, it might contains some errors as the IsKing Function is not compelete.

Contributions and feedback are welcome, and users are free to fork the repository and make modifications or additions to the game as they see fit.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository
Compile the program using a C++ compiler
Run the executable to start the game
Follow the instructions to play the game
